# Streamflow-and-Flood-Analysis-System-Using-R-SFASUR-TEC-

ABSTRACT
The Streamflow and Flood Analysis System Using R (SFASUR-TEC) was developed as part of a research
project focusing on hydrological modelling for operational hydropower planning and forecasting in tropical
mountainous regions of Costa Rica. Since Costa Rica has an enormous hydropower potential and renewable
energy markets keep growing, reliable estimation and assessment of river flows is imperative. SFASUR-TEC
was developed to increase the understanding of natural and altered flow regimes linked to relevant physical
processes with a particular interest in hydropower applications. Consequently, SFASUR-TEC is a collection of
methods to identify and quantify key components of flow regimes and assess their behaviour through time.
The system was completely developed using the R programming language based on various criteria, including
availability of specialized libraries, open-source implementation and cross-platform compatibility. To evaluate
the performance of the system, SFASUR-TEC was applied to the upper Toro River catchment in Costa Rica
using a 17-year streamflow data set (1994-2010). The catchment was selected based on its predominantly
mountainous and rainy conditions, its relevance in the Costa Rican hydropower generation context and the
availability of temporal and spatial information. Results from the Flood Frequency Analysis Block, suggest a
60 m3/s peak flow for a 20-year return period (FFATr20) along with its 95% confidence intervals with values
between 42 and 93 m3/s. Flow Duration Curves (FDCs) show that the dry season expands from February
through April, with flow values as low as 1.5 m3/s, essentially sustained by baseflow. Baseflow Separation
shows that baseflow is indeed a considerable contribution to total streamflow, with BFI values ranging from
0.12 to 0.40 between the months of May through December. Results from this study are intended to support
strategic decision-making to improve the performance of the hydropower facilities currently installed in the
upper Toro River catchment and elsewhere.
